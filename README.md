NOTE: The instructions for the challenges are in Spanish,
maybe when I have enough time I'll try to translate them.

NOTE: These solutions do not try to be the most simple and pretty. Also, my goal is not to get the highest score possible,
just to solve the challenge :sweat_smile: (I'm just a beginner who likes to code).
